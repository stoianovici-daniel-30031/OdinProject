    <h1><strong>DARIUS</strong></h1>
    <h3><strong>THE HAND OF NOXUS</strong></h3>
    <p>Darius and his brother Draven grew up as orphans in the port city of Basilich.<br> 
        Darius struggled to provide for them both, constantly fighting with gangs of older <br>
        urchins and anyone else who threatened his little brother—even the city guard.<br> 
        Every day on the streets was a battle for survival, and Darius earned more scars <br> 
        by his twelfth summer than some soldiers do in a lifetime.</p>

     <p>
        After Basilich was seized by the expanding Noxian empire, the victorious commander <br>
        Cyrus saw the strength in these defiant brothers, and they found a home within the <br>
        ranks of his warhost. Over the years, they fought in many grueling campaigns of <br>
        conquest from one end of the known world to the other, as well as crushing a <br>
        number of rebellions against the throne.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Within the empire, anyone could rise to power, no matter their birth, culture, <br>
        or background, and none embraced this ideal more fervently than Darius. <br>
        From humble beginnings, he rose steadily through the ranks, <br>
        always putting duty before all else, and garnering great respect for his aggression,<br>
         discipline, and refusal to ever take a backward step. <br>
         On the bloodsoaked fields of Dalamor Plain, he even beheaded a Noxian general <br>
         after the coward ordered a retreat. Roaring in defiance and hefting his bloodied <br>
         axe overhead, Darius rallied the scattered warbands and won a great and unexpected <br>
         victory against a far more numerous foe. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        He was rewarded with a senior command of his own, attracting many thousands of eager <br>
        recruits from across the empire. Darius turned the majority away, accepting only the <br>
        strongest, the most disciplined and iron-willed. Such was his fearsome notoriety, <br>
        even in the lands beyond Noxus, that it was not uncommon for entire cities to <br>
        surrender at the first sight of his banners. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        After a grinding victory against the cloud-fortresses of the Varju, a proud warrior <br>
        people who had resisted decades of Noxian aggression, Darius was named the <br>
        Hand of Noxus by Emperor Boram Darkwill himself. Those who knew Darius best knew <br>
        he craved neither power nor adulation—he wished merely to see Noxus triumph over <br>
        all—so Darkwill ordered him and his warhosts far north into the Freljord, <br>
        to finally bring the barbarian tribes to heel. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The campaign dragged on for years, ending in a bitter, icy stalemate. <br>
        Darius narrowly survived assassination attempts, ambushes, and even capture by <br>
        the vicious <em>Winter’s Claw.</em> He was growing weary of endless wars of attrition, <br>
        and returned to Noxus to demand a reconsolidation of the military.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        He marched his veterans into the capital, only to find that the emperor was dead,<br>
        killed in a coup led by Jericho Swain. The act had been supported by many allies,<br>
        including Darius’s own brother, Draven. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        his was a difficult position. As Hand, many of the noble houses would expect Darius <br>
        to avenge Darkwill, but he had known and greatly respected the disgraced general<br>
        Swain, and had spoken against his discharge after the botched offensive in Ionia <br>
        some years earlier. The oaths of the Hand were to Noxus, not any particular ruler,<br>
        and Swain was a man who spoke honestly of his new vision for the empire. <br>
        Darius realized this was a leader he was prepared to follow... but Swain had other ideas.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        With the establishment of the <em>Trifarix</em>, three individuals would rule Noxus together,<br>
        each embodying one principle of strength: Vision, Might, and Guile. <br>
        Darius gladly accepted his place on this council, and pledged to raise a new, <br>
        elite force—the <em>Trifarian Legion/em>, the most loyal and prestigious warriors the empire <br>
        could produce—and lead the armies of Noxus into a glorious new age of conquest. <br>
